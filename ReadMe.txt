Welcome to the Automated Risk Identification Project documentation. This project aims to revolutionize risk management by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to automate the process of risk identification and prioritization. With a focus on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), this innovative solution categorizes risks into Information Security (IS) and Data Privacy (DP) risks, providing a standardized approach to risk management.

Machine Learning Models
The heart of the project lies in its machine learning models, each tailored to predict specific aspects of risk:

Likelihood of Attack
Name
Prerequisites
Skills Required
Consequences
Mitigations

Download this repository extract model.rar in same directory.
it create folder named as "model" it contains "model.pickle"

Now open terminal in same direcotry 

Step 1:
    First install requirements.txt using command 

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 2: 
    Run App.py Using command

    python App.py


Now visit localhost  http://127.0.0.1:5000 (ensure port Number)
